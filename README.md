# virtual pubquiz

A virtual pubquiz, which enables players or guests to participate in everybody's favorite guessing+drinking game,
and allows pub owners to keep the connection to their regulars and even generate some revenue.

This project was started as part of the [WirVsVirus-Hackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/).

You can get an impression on how the app looks like [in our mock up](https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/8X3YZTXKBV5/).

# Developing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Yarn

## Building and Running

- Clone this repository.
- cd into the cloned repository and do `yarn install`
- cd into `./client` and do `yarn install` again.

For running both server and client concurrently, run

- `yarn dev` in the root folder of the cloned repository.

For starting server or client individually, run

- `yarn client` will start the client only.
- `yarn server` will start the server only.

# Roadmap

We are very proud of how far we have come during that hackathon. But we also don't want to stop here. Some TODOs which we have in mind are

- polish the rough edges
- deploying the pubquiz to a server for everybody to test playing
- find a pub owner who wants to host a quiz. If you are one, please reach out to us, either here on github or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/contradictioned)
